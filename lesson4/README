I implemented a dataflow analysis framework and used it to perform one
particular analysis, copy propagation. I have not tested it with other
dataflow analyses.

It works for simple control-flow graphs, as demonstrated by the tests
basic.bril and branch.bril, but it fails for more complicated
control-flow graphs, as demonstrated by multi_branch.bril and
pythagorean_triple.bril. I think it is failing due to bugs in the
control-flow graph generation code rather than bugs in the dataflow
analysis or copy propagation code, but obviously I don't know this for
sure. I have run out of time to fix these bugs because unfortunately I
am bad at time management.

Note: we did dataflow analysis in CS 4120, and I used pieces of that
code as reference, but the code here is newly created for this
assignment.
